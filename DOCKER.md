# Running Localbots on a server with Docker

This guide is for the person hosting Localbots for a group. You do not need to
know anything about the project — the container builds SimulationCraft itself,
so there is nothing to install by hand.

Everyone in the group then opens `http://your-server:4747` in a browser and
sims from there. No client install, no accounts.

---

## Before you start

You need **Docker** with the **Compose** plugin. On a fresh Debian/Ubuntu box:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com | sh
```

Check it works:

```bash
docker compose version
```

**What the machine needs:**

| | |
|---|---|
| CPU | 2 cores works; 4+ makes sims noticeably faster |
| RAM | **4 GB minimum** — compiling SimulationCraft is the memory-hungry part, not running it |
| Disk | give it 5 GB free — the build stage is much larger than the final image, and Docker keeps both until you prune |
| Time | **15–45 minutes for the first build**, depending on core count. It compiles SimulationCraft from source. Later builds reuse the cache and are much quicker. |

The build tools are thrown away at the end: only the finished 122 MB simc
binary, Node and the app ship in the running image.

Reclaim the leftover build layers once you are happy it works:

```bash
docker builder prune
```

---

## Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/santisanudo13/localbots.git
```

```bash
cd localbots && docker compose up -d --build
```

That is the whole install. Go and do something else while it compiles.

When it finishes, check it came up:

```bash
docker compose ps
```

You want to see `localbots` with status `running (healthy)`. Health takes about
10 seconds to report after start.

### One thing to do in the browser

Open `http://your-server:4747`, go to the **Droptimizer** tab, and click
**Refresh data**. That downloads about 60 MB of game tables. It is a one-time
step — the data is kept in a Docker volume and survives restarts and rebuilds.

Until you do it, sims still work but the Droptimizer has no items to offer.

---

## Day-to-day

```bash
docker compose logs -f
```

```bash
docker compose restart
```

```bash
docker compose stop
```

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

The in-page **"Shut down server"** button is deliberately hidden in the
container. On a shared server any visitor could otherwise stop everyone's sims.
Stop it from the shell instead. If you want the button back, set
`LOCALBOTS_ALLOW_SHUTDOWN: "1"` in `docker-compose.yml`.

---

## Updating

### When Localbots itself changes

```bash
cd localbots && git pull && docker compose up -d --build
```

Your game data and everyone's sim history are in volumes, so they survive.

### On WoW patch day

The one-click **Simc** update button in the header is hidden in the container
on purpose — there is no source tree inside the image to update. Instead:

```bash
cd localbots && git pull && docker compose up -d --build
```

The image tracks SimulationCraft's branch head, so when simc has moved on this
recompiles it; when it has not, the cached build is reused and the rebuild is
quick. Then click **Refresh data** in the Droptimizer tab once to re-download
the game tables for the new build.

If you suspect the image is stale anyway, force everything:

```bash
docker compose build --no-cache && docker compose up -d
```

That click is still needed here. On a desktop install the Simc update button
refreshes the game data by itself, but in the container simc is replaced by a
rebuild rather than by that button, so nothing triggers the download for you.

The header has a **Simc** light that turns orange when the simc in the image is
older than the live game build — that is your cue to run the above.

### When a new expansion lands

SimulationCraft renames its branch each expansion. Change `SIMC_BRANCH` in
`docker-compose.yml` (currently `midnight`) and rebuild.

## Optional: live Armory lookups

Localbots can look characters up by name. With no setup it uses a free public
scan, which works but runs slightly behind. Free Blizzard API credentials make
it a live read instead.

Get a client id and secret at
[develop.battle.net](https://develop.battle.net/access/clients), then create a
`.env` file next to `docker-compose.yml`:

```bash
printf 'BLIZZARD_CLIENT_ID=your_id\nBLIZZARD_CLIENT_SECRET=your_secret\n' > .env && chmod 600 .env
```

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

Compose reads that file automatically. It is gitignored and excluded from the
image, so the secret is not baked into anything you might share. Treat the
secret like a password: anyone holding it can make API calls billed to that
developer account.

## What "shared" actually means

- **Sims run one at a time.** If three people press Sim at once, they queue.
  Each person sees their place in the line, what is running in front of them
  and how far along it is, and the line counts down live as sims finish.
  Nobody's run is dropped, and nobody has to keep pressing anything.
- **The History page is shared.** Everyone sees everyone's saved sims, including
  character names. That is fine for a friend group; just know it is not private.
- **Everything else is per-browser.** The profile you paste stays in your own tab.

---

## Security — read this before opening it to the internet

**Localbots has no login and no passwords.** Anyone who can reach port 4747 can
run sims, see the shared history, and download game data on your bandwidth.

That is fine on a home LAN or a private VPN. If you want to reach it from
outside, do one of these rather than forwarding the port directly:

- **Tailscale / WireGuard** — simplest. Everyone joins the private network and
  uses the server's private address. Nothing is exposed publicly.
- **A reverse proxy with a password** — Caddy, nginx or Traefik in front of
  Localbots, with basic auth and HTTPS.

To keep it strictly local-only, bind the port to loopback in
`docker-compose.yml` and reach it through an SSH tunnel or proxy:

```yaml
ports:
  - "127.0.0.1:4747:4747"
```

---

## Where the data lives

Two Docker volumes:

| Volume | Holds | Safe to delete? |
|---|---|---|
| `localbots-cache` | downloaded game tables (~60 MB) | yes — click Refresh data again |
| `localbots-history` | everyone's saved sims | no — this is the only copy |

Back up the history:

```bash
docker run --rm -v localbots-history:/h -v "$PWD":/out alpine tar czf /out/localbots-history.tar.gz -C /h .
```

---

## Changing the port

If 4747 is taken, edit `docker-compose.yml`:

```yaml
ports:
  - "8080:4747"
```

Left side is the port on the server, right side is inside the container — leave
the right side alone.

---

## If something goes wrong

**The build fails partway through compiling simc.** Almost always out of memory.
Give the machine more RAM or add swap, then rebuild. A 2 GB VPS will not compile
SimulationCraft.

**The build fails at `git clone`.** The branch name changed. Check what branches
exist at `github.com/simulationcraft/simc` and update `SIMC_BRANCH` in
`docker-compose.yml`.

**The page loads but every sim fails.** Check the logs:

```bash
docker compose logs --tail=50
```

**The Droptimizer says data is missing or from the wrong game build.** Click
**Refresh data**. If it still complains, the simc in the image is older than the
live game — rebuild with `--no-cache` as described under patch day.

**Nothing responds on the port.** Confirm the container is healthy with
`docker compose ps`, then check the server's firewall allows 4747.

**Start completely fresh** (this deletes saved sims):

```bash
docker compose down -v && docker compose up -d --build
```
